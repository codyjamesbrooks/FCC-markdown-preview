const defaultText = `
# Check out this Title
## Now check out this sub-title
### But is a sub-sub-title possible?
#### It is... but wait there is more!

This next bit is subtle. But check this out.

Did you catch that? It is ok if you didn't, its was kind of subtle. I will do it a couple more times and i'm sure you will pick up on it.

How is this whole thing possible? Let me tell you while (while showing you some more features)

1. So what we are doing is taking text, that has some very simple syntax rules.

3. Then we pass that text through a javaScript function, that looks for the syntax rules that were followed in the text

2. That javaScript function, spits out some wonderfully formatted, presentational quality, text. 

4. And that is it.

Pretty cool huh? Did you catch that I didn't even count out the steps on those instructions correctly. It didn't even matter. Even people who are unable to count can now make numbered lists!
